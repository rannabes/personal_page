        I was born and raised in Tehran which is the capital city of Iran.
        I am happily married and have two beautiful daughters, Helena and Heava
        born on 2015 and 2019. I immigrated to Canada in 2010 to persue my PhD
        degree in quantum information science.

        My passion about physics started in teenagehood, looking at the sky and
        wondering how the unverse was created and where the it ends.
        To feed my curiousity, I persued physics as an undergrad
        with the hope of discovering the mistery of unverse creation. But, when
        I was introduced to quantum mechanics and observed counter-intuitive
        behaviour of sub-atomic particles, I swinged my direction of curiousity
        from discovering macroscopic universe to understanding the microscopic
        world.

        My graad school was exclusively focused on various areas in the field of
        quantum computation and quantum communication. I have worked on various
        projects, naming QKD for satellite communication, Nitrogen-Vacancy centers
        in diamonds, symmetry protected qubits and collective
        dynamics of open quantum systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduatin in 2016, I have worked for Xanadu Quantum Technologies
        in Toronto, Transformative Quangtum Technologies in Waterloo and Anyon
        Systems Inc. in Montreal, Canada. I am currentlt working for the government
        of Canada as quantum strategy advisor.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a social person and enjoy gathering with friends and family. My
        personal life has given me a special strength that helps me to be a
        wise and influencial mother, an inspiring friend and an advanced skill
        teacher.I enjoy educating, mentoring and training younger generations.
